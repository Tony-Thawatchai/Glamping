                    <p class="teaser"> A cottage, during England's feudal period, was the holding by a cottager (known
                        as a
                        cotter or bordar) of a small house with enough garden to feed a family and in return for the
                        cottage, the cottager had to provide some form of service to the manorial lord.[2] However, in
                        time
                        cottage just became the general term for a small house. In modern usage, a cottage is usually a
                        modest, often cosy dwelling, typically in a rural or semi-rural location and not necessarily in
                        England. The cottage orné, often quite large and grand residences built by the nobility, dates
                        back
                        to a movement of "rustic" stylised cottages of the late 18th and early 19th century during the
                        Romantic movement.
                        In British English the term now denotes a small dwelling of traditional build, although it can
                        also
                        be applied to modern construction designed to resemble traditional houses ("mock cottages").
                        Cottages may be detached houses, or terraced, such as those built to house workers in mining
                        villages. The tied accommodation provided to farm workers was usually a cottage, see cottage
                        garden.
                        In England the term holiday cottage now denotes a specialised form of residential let property,
                        attracting various tax benefits to the owner.
                        The holiday cottage exists in many cultures under different names. In American English,
                        "cottage" is
                        one term for such holiday homes, although they may also be called a "cabin", "chalet", or even
                        "camp". In Australia, the term "cabin" is common, cottage usually referring to a smaller
                        pre-modern
                        period dwelling. In certain countries (e.g. Nordics, Baltics, and Russia) the term "cottage" has
                        local synonyms: In Finnish mökki, in Estonian suvila, in Latvian vasarnīca, in Livonian
                        sõvvõkuodā,
                        in Swedish stuga, in Norwegian hytte (from the German word Hütte), in Czech or Slovak chata or
                        chalupa, in Russian дача (dacha, which can refer to a vacation/summer home, often located near a
                        body of water).[3]
                        In places such as Canada, "cottage" carries no connotations of size (compare with vicarage or
                        hermitage).

                    <p class="teaser"> Glamping is a portmanteau of "glamorous" and "camping", and describes a style of
                        camping with amenities and, in some cases, resort-style services not usually associated with
                        "traditional" camping. Glamping has become particularly popular with 21st-century tourists
                        seeking modern amenities, such as Wi-Fi,[1] alongside "the escapism and adventure recreation of
                        camping",[2][3][4][5] in a variety of accommodations such as cabins, treehouses, and tents.[1]
